# CTOOLS

A small library packing some useful sub-routines often encountered with the C language:
- [RAM] C memory managment: track all malloc, calloc, realloc and free calls in order to avoid memory leaks. (This uses the [TRACKER] module)
- [TRACKER] Global memory managment: register a unique memory address (i.e `void*`) and unregister it before calling a trace function. Any memory address not unregistered is returned via the trace call.
- [LOGGER] Personalized thread-safe (POSIX) logger. (Code fully generated by macros)
- [LIST] List builder with a pre-definite data type. A single macro imitate a template behavior in order to generate the code needed for this list. The standard list functions are included: `append` `remove` `insert` `find` and `resize`.
